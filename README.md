## Overview:

This web app is intended as an education tool to help novice bicycle riders to better understand how gears function.

There are a handful of ways of explaining the mechanics of a bicycle's gearing, most are loaded with jargon and factor in a lot of unique and specific measurements that typically aren't beginner friendly. 

This app focuses on **gain ratio** which focuses essentially on how many times the rear wheel turns per revolution of the pedals. 

## Features:

_Real part options_ : only real world parts can be selected to calculate gear ratios - parts come from our (growing) database of current components.

_Compare Equipment_ : users are able to view a sample of current components at every skill level - and compare their own gear choices.
  
_Graphics_ : simple and easy to understand animations are used to illustrate the pedaling output.  
  
_Mobile first development_ : web based and agnostic to operating system.
